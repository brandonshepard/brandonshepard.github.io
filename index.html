        <p>Welcome to my website!

        <p>I'm planning to use the site as a place to
            share things I enjoy. Some future topics may include
            my favorite recipes, book summaries and silly memes 
            (among other things).

        <p>I also have the intention of creating a knowledge
            base as a place to record and reinforce what I am 
		learning, so hopefully that will show up here too.
