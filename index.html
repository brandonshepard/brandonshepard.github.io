        <p>Welcome to my website!

        <p>I'm planning to use the site as a centralized place to
            share things I enjoy. Some future topics may include
            my favorite recipes, book summaries and silly memes 
            (among other things).

        <p>I've also had the intention of creating a knowledge
            base, so hopefully that will show up here too.
